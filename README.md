# 🌍 Climate Downscaling using Super-Resolution CNNs

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNNs) can be used to downscale climate model outputs from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) using synthetic temperature field data. It is a simplified and educational approach to learn the application of deep learning in climate science.

## 🧪 Features

- Generates synthetic climate data (temperature grids)
- Simulates low-resolution fields by downsampling and upsampling
- Trains a SRCNN to reconstruct high-resolution fields
- Compares predicted vs actual high-resolution outputs
- Exports LR and HR synthetic data to Excel
